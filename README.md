# Constructing diverse urban clusters based on population distribution and interaction
by Wenpu Cao, Lei Dong, Ying Cheng, Lun Wu, and Yu Liu

## Abstract
A city (or an urban cluster) is not an isolated spatial unit, but a combination of areas with closely linked socio-economic activities. However, so far, we lack a universal and quantitative approach to define cities/urban clusters with these socio-economic connections. Here, using granular population distribution and flow data in China, we propose a bottom-up approach to quantify urban clusters at multi-levels. We reveal six ‘phases’ (i.e., levels) in the population density-flow diagram, each of which corresponds to a spatial definition of urban systems from large to small. Furthermore, our results show that the Zipf’s law and the population-area allometric growth only appear after the fifth level, responding to the long-debated spatial dependence of urban laws. Our approach is not dependent on pre-defined city boundaries and can be applied effectively on a global scale.

## Replication data and codes
1. Data
- HomeDensity\_CHN: Population density data.
- clusterAreas: Area of each population cluster under each density threshold.
- clusterFlows: Flow ratio between any two population clusters under each density threshold.
2. Codes 
- 1-PCCA: Clustering by population density thresholds.
- 2-DensityFlow: Grouping by flow ratio thresholds
- 3-Phase: Plot the density-flow phase diagram.
- 4-Map: Generate maps of urban clusters at each level.
3. Results
- UrbanClusters: Maps of urban clusters at each level.
